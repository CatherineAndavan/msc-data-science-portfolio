## Projects Overview

### 1. Food Identification with Segmentation
Semantic segmentation of food images using DeepLabV3 with ResNet-101 on the FoodSeg103 dataset. Focused on ingredient-level recognition with a mean IoU of 41.69%.

### 2. Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation
Combining CLIP and T5-small to match idioms in sentences with corresponding images. Fine-tuning improved accuracy to 81.48%, demonstrating context-aware multimodal learning.

### 3. Text Generator
Generates text in the style of Agatha Christie using LSTM-based sequence modeling. Includes preprocessing, embedding layers, and model evaluation with early stopping.

### 4. Fine-Grained Bird Species Classification
Classifies bird species using EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning and fine-tuning. Achieved 90.62% accuracy, with evaluation using precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### 5. Face Translation using CycleGAN
Unpaired image-to-image translation between human and animal faces using CycleGAN. Demonstrates effective style transfer and preservation of key facial features.

### 6. Image Denoising with Wavelet Transformation
Implements Haar Wavelet-based denoising of PGM images using FDWT and IDWT with thresholding. Successfully reduces noise while preserving image details.

### 7. Regression-Classification-NLP
This project contains three distinct machine learning projects demonstrating classification, regression, and NLP tasks:

1. Classification (Injury Severity Prediction)  
   - Goal: Predict the severity of a person's injury using the FARS dataset  
   - Approach: Preprocessed data with one-hot encoding and standardization; trained Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers  
   - Results: Decision Tree achieved 75.9% accuracy and F1 score; Random Forest expected to improve performance

2. Regression (Bacteria Growth Prediction)  
   - Goal: Predict bacteria growth  
   - Approach: Used Linear Regression, SVR, and RandomForestRegressor  
   - Results: SVR performed best with R-squared = 0.903

3. NLP (News Article Topic Modeling)  
   - Goal: Cluster news articles by topics  
   - Approach: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, LDA and Agglomerative Clustering  
   - Results: LDA produced more defined clusters with less overlap
